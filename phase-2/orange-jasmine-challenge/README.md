# Orange Trees

## Learning Competencies

* Use Testing to TDD JavaScript code with Jasmine.
* Use basic JavaScript - functions, control structures, scope.
* Write OO JavaScript
* Use jQuery effects like toggle, show, hide, animate
* Write custom event handlers in JavaScript and jQuery

## Summary

Remember our old friend **Orange Trees** from Ruby? Let's revisit it in
JavaScript.  While this assignment might look _superficially_ easy you can make
this a very powerful and elegant program and unify the lessons of [The
Prophetess Metz's][metz] scrolls *as well* what you know about how to write
Javascript objects.

Here are some features:

* A tree can age.
* For each year the tree ages up to its fruit bearing age, it gets taller.
* After a tree reaches fruit bearing age, it can grow fruit.
* A tree grows a random amount of oranges each year it ages (after reaching
  fruit bearing age)
* An orange has a random diameter.
* You can pick all the fruit that grows each year.
* Any un-picked fruit dies when the tree ages again.
* A tree dies after it ages for its max age years and can no longer bear
  fruit.

## Releases

### Release 0 : Working with Jasmine

We've written a lot of tests for you in Jasmine, your job is to write the code
to make these tests pass.  Start your test server by running `rake jasmine`.
You should see your first failing test.  Write code in
`src/plain-old-js-objects.js` to make this test pass.  Then uncomment the next
test (change the `xit` to `it`) and keep going.

### Release 1 : Plain Old JavaScript Objects (Object Literals)

Here we'll be building objects with functions. In this release we will create an
orange tree, age the tree, grow oranges on the tree, and pick fruit off the
tree.  We will model all of this using JavaScript functions and
Plain-Old-JavaScript-Objects(aka Object-Literals -- without constructor functions).

* One by one, make the
  [plain-old-js-objects-spec](./spec/javascripts/plain-old-js-objects-spec.js)
  pass without using prototypes or constructor functions. Use the
  [plain-old-js-objects](./javascripts/src/plain-old-js-objects.js) file.
* Refactor your JavaScript source files!
* Refactor your spec files!

### Release 2 : JavaScript Constructor Function Objects

In this release we will AGAIN create an orange tree, age the tree, grow oranges
on the tree, and pick fruit off the tree.  We will model all of this using
JavaScript constructor functions and Prototypes.

* One by one, copy the plain old js objects spec into the typed objects spec.
  However, change them to use the `new OrangeTree` and `prototype` syntax as you
  do. use the `javascripts/typed-js-objects.js` file.
* Refactor your JavaScript source files!
* Refactor your spec files!

### Release 3 : The view

Now let's add some interaction with the DOM. Write your DOM interaction code in
`view.js` using the [jQuery library][]. Use either the
objects you built in release 1 or 2.

In this release, let's try writing the code first and then the tests.  We've
provided you a primitive HTML shell in [`orange.html`](./orange.html).

* Write code that allows you to `plant` a tree by clicking a button. It should
  make the tree become visible on the screen somehow.  Look at
  `#orange-tree-template`.  It's not showing when the page loads, could you use
  JavaScript to change a CSS property on that div to make it appear?  Once the
  tree is visible can you make the button become disabled?
* Write code that allows you to `age` a tree by clicking a button.  If you age
  the tree enough there should be oranges that appear on the tree (use the
  orange image).  The age of the tree should be shown in the `p.age` element.
  The total number of oranges it has should be shown in `p.fruit-count`.
* Write code that allows you to `pick` an orange off a tree by clicking a
  button.  This should decrease the count of fruits as well as remove an image

**WARNING**:  Congratulations - you've reached the edge of procedural code.  To
achieve the goals of Release 3 you _could_ do a very procedural implementation
- but each additional change of functionality will be painful and make you sad.
Try to figure out how to implement the MVC pattern in JavaScript.  MVC has
nothing to do with how files are laid out or any particular language but is a
way of identifying primary responsibilities and associating them with classes.
As we said, above, Orange Trees is a simple application that affords you the
change _to create a beautiful implementation_.  Take advantage of this
narrowly-focused application to build your skills!

### Release 4

Explore the `jasmine-jquery` gem to write tests for the jQuery code in the
previous release.

### Release 5

* Have some fun.  Can you add a pear tree? Can you do it TDD?
* Can you pick all the fruit that grows each year and put it in a basket?
* Can you know the number of fruit in the basket and the average diameter of
  that fruit at any time?
